The Vacuum Cleaning Game is an engaging and interactive project designed to simulate the operation of a vacuum cleaner within a 2-dimensional room. 
The objective of the game is to navigate the vacuum cleaner across the room while adhering to specific rules and avoiding obstacles.


In this game, the player controls the vacuum cleaner using a set of predefined commands. The room, represented as a grid, has boundaries that the vacuum cleaner must not cross. 
Additionally, the room may contain blocks or barriers that the vacuum cleaner must avoid. 
The challenge lies in efficiently maneuvering the vacuum cleaner within the given space, cleaning as much of the room as possible without hitting any blocks or crossing the boundaries.
